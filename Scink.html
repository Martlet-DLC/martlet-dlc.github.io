          <p class="lead my-3">笔者以此文为目标文献T，在 Web of Science 上爬取引用 T 的一级子文献 S1；再以每篇子文献为目标，爬取引用 S1 的二级子文献 S2；三级子文献同理。经过长达二十多小时的数据抓取，最终在SQLite3中生成848个数据表，获得3,048,773(≈300万)条文献数据，记录了每篇文献记录的作者、标题、出处、DOI、发表年份、被引量，以及与父文献的引用关系信息。
          <p class="lead my-3">为了对得到的文献信息进行可视化分析，笔者制作了引用关系图、文献 T 的被引数逐年增量柱状图、子文献出处的期刊分布情况饼状图，以及文献标题词云图。详见  结果与分析。</p>

        </p>
          <p class="lead my-3 mb-auto">
          以文献标题(Title)为节点名(name)，文献来源(Source)为节点值(value)，根据被引量(TimesCited)设置节点大小(symbol_size)，并根据数据表名称(floor_room)判断文献层级，以设置category值，用红、藏青、青蓝、肉橙色分别区分目标文献和一、二、三级子文献；最后根据DOI和FormerDOI的联系连线，得到如下文献引用关系网。图中最醒目的一级引用文献 "Generalized Gradient Approximation Made Simple"，正是目前最好的泛函形式——GGA的出处。

        从图中可以看出，随着DFT方法的不断发展壮大，越来越多的新文章引用了Kohn-Sham在1965年的研究成果。这股上升趋势的起点大致在1990年（之前每年引用数基本都没超过300）。回溯历史，1989年，Parr和杨伟涛出书"Density functional theory of atoms and molecules"，对传播DFT有很大推动作用；1992年，著名计算软件Gaussian92开始支持DFT，从此DFT开始风靡分子领域。

        1972到1980年，子文献主要发表在晶体学相关的期刊上，之后则主要分布在 Physical Review和物理化学期刊上；材料和无机化学相关的期刊发布数稳定居于前十之列，而与应用相关的期刊自2007年后，才进入发布数前十期刊之列。由此可见，晶体学是DFT早期应用领域，材料和无机分子始终是重点应用对象，且近年来随着DFT方法的发展完善，逐渐开始在实际应用领域发挥作用。

        从中可明显看出，DFT方法关注的重点是电子、结构、分子、表面，主要工具有第一性原理、理论计算、泛函、从头计算方法、量子理论等。可以想见，若是换成另一个领域的开创性文献，通过Scink收集数据，再用pyecharts制作词云图，即可一览该领域关注的重点和主要的研究方法。
